# mayhem
Mayhem, or Total Mayhem, is a mod for the game Total Annihilation.

The goal is to make all of the original units useful, and add more units for more strategic choices.

The main file mayhem.gp3 is a HAPI archive (like zip, but with less metadata) that replaces the original content of the game with modified versions of this content.

This repo is for the purpose of tracking changes to the files contained in mayhem.gp3.

gamma, @gammata, is the main author.
