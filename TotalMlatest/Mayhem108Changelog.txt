**Mayhem 10.8.2** change list
**Balance changes**
- improved AA missile accuracy vs air - mostly increased weaponacceleration, but increased turnrate and max velocity in some cases too
- **T2 bombers** increase energy cost and buildtime ~15%
- **Arm Blade** increase energy cost 10%
- **all air plants** default standing move order changed to "Manuever". On "Hold Position" aircraft don't auto-attack anything unless it's REALLY close. Manuever is a good balance where they stay within the vicinity and don't Roam but they still attack. All other factories are default hold position to prioritise unit control
- **Prophet, Omen, Mofo, Harbinger, Epoch, Magnate, Hamster, Argoth** - long (or longish) range 3-weapon mobile units swap weapons so the long-range weapon is weapon 3, so they can attack ground from a distance without trying to get in range of weapon 2.
**Bugfix list**
- **Krab** - make the shorter range laser an independent turret on top
- **Core Minelayer factory** UI fix
- **Thunder, Shadow** can now actually be built in Seaplane Platform
- reduce range of pseudo-weapon for aiming factory build pads for less annoying sounds from the AI
- **Harbinger** fix model corruption - and upscale flak turret a little
- **Hamster** fix incorrect/outdated buildpic 
**updated nanoframe preview feature** (dsound.dll)

- Vulcan, Buzzsaw, Dora and Terminator small reduction in health, increase energy cost
- Vulcan and Buzzsaw increase cost per shot and faster reload. Increase metal cost and buildtime
- Dora/Terminator increase reload to 25/28 seconds (from 20/25). Reduce damage per burst for Terminator to 15900 from 16800.
- Drake and Krogoth - increase damage for miniguns/arm guns, reduce weapontimer on missiles so they turn to hit target faster 
- T3 vehicle plants tweaks to yardmap
**bugfixes etc**
- fix missing wakes on Firedevil
- remove onoff button from Guardian
- change pathfinding cycles to 366650 from 66650
