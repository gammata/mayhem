**Mayhem 10.8.2** change list
**Balance changes**

- **all air plants** default standing move order changed to "Manuever". On "Hold Position" aircraft don't auto-attack anything unless it's REALLY close. Manuever is a good balance where they stay within the vicinity and don't Roam but they still attack. All other factories are default hold position to prioritise unit control
- **Prophet, Omen, Mofo, Harbinger, Epoch, Magnate, Hamster, Argoth** - long (or longish) range 3-weapon mobile units swap weapons so the long-range weapon is weapon 3, so they can attack ground from a distance without trying to get in range of weapon 2.
