; Default list of maps that the Random Map Selector (tm) will chose from, with weightings.
; Thanks to Xeno for making the list of mapnames!
;
; Structure of this file (quite simple)
;
; +Group_name
; <weight> <mapname>
; <weight> <mapname>
; ...
; +Group_name
; ...
;
; NOTE: If you want to disable a group, just remove the + since all lines that doesn't start with either an 
;       integer or a + will be considered as groups to ignore. (and no +10 won't count as an integer). If you want 
;       to disable a specific map, just delete the line or perhaps set the weight to 0. 
;
; About the weightings: They are an INTEGER, and the chance for getting a certain map is proportional to
;                       <map_weighting> / <sum_of_all>.
